# 💸 Expense Tracker App

A simple **Expense Tracker App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps you record daily expenses, keep track of the total, and delete items when needed.  
You can either select an expense from a dropdown list (Food, Rent, Transportation, etc.) or manually type your own expense name.
